# Sales Insights Data Analysis Project

## Introduction:
AtliQ Hardware is a reputable company that specializes in the supply of computer hardware and peripherals throughout India. With multiple branches located in different cities, the sales director, Bhaven Patel, is responsible for monitoring the company's profitability and identifying areas where product sales can be increased to boost revenue.

## Problem Statement:
Unfortunately, Bhaven Patel faces a significant challenge in accessing sales data from the various branches located across different cities. Despite requesting weekly or monthly reports from branch managers, he lacks a centralized platform or dashboard that can provide graphical insights into the performance of each regional branch. This makes it difficult for him to quickly identify patterns or trends and make data-driven decisions. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop a dashboard that can provide easy access to the sales data, visual representations of performance metrics, and other key performance indicators to help Bhaven Patel make informed business decisions.

## Planning
